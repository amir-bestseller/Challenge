## DevOps Challenge

- terraform init is to initialize the working directory and downloading plugins of the AWS provider

- terraform plan is to create the execution plan for code

- terraform apply is to create the actual infrastructure. It will ask you to provide the Access Key and Secret Key in order to create the infrastructure. So, instead of hardcoding the Access Key and Secret Key, it is better to apply at the run time.
